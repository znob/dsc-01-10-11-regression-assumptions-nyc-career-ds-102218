    "Regression is a powerful analysis technique that is routinely used to answer complex analytical questions. However, if you don’t satisfy some assumptions, you might not be able to trust the results.\n",

    "## Regression is \"Parametric\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is a parametric technique i.e. it uses parameters learned from the data, so it makes certain assumptions assumptions. These assumptions define the complete scope of regression analysis and it is **mandatory** that underlying data fulfills these assumptions. If these assumptions are violated, regression makes biased and unreliable predictions. Luckily, we have measures to check for these assumptions which will be mentioned below. "

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown above, If we try to fit a linear model to a non-linear data set, OLS would fail to capture the trend mathematically, thus resulting in an inaccurate relationship. Also, this will result in erroneous predictions on an unseen data set.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">The linearity assumption can best be tested with scatter plots \n",
    "\n",
    "For non-linear relationships, we can use non-linear mathematical functions to fit the data e.g. polynomial and exponential functions. These will be covered soon in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: As an extra measure, you must also check for outliers as presence of outliers in the data can have a major impact on the model.**\n",

    ">Satisfying the normality assumption allows you to perform statistical hypothesis testing and generate reliable confidence intervals and prediction intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity assumption requires variables to be normally distributed for concluding some sort of statistical significance. It also require that the calculated error values also follow a normal distribution to produce unbiased estimates with the minimum variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, keep in mind that this assumption is not mandatory for regression if you dont want to do any hypothesis testing. OLS works fine for non-normal data distributions in the context of prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to check for this assumption is with histograms or a Q-Q-Plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Histograms\n",
    "We have already seen quite a few histograms and also know how to build them for data variables while plotting the density function through parametric and non parametric means. On the same lines, the errors generated by the model can also be checked for normality. As the error term follows a normal distribution, we can develop a better confidence on the results and thus calculate the statistical significance. An example of a regression error histogram is shown below:\n",

    "### Q-Q Plots\n",
    "\n",
    ">In statistics, a Q–Q (quantile-quantile) plot is a probability plot, which is a graphical method for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q-Q plot (quantile-quantile plot) is used to help assess if a dataset comes from a known distribution such as a Normal or exponential etc. For regression, when checking if the data is Normally distributed, we can use a Normal Q-Q plot to check that assumption. Remember It is just a visual check, not quantitative, so its interpretation remains subjective. However, it is a good first check to see the overall shape of data against required distribution. If you can reject normality through QQ plot, you have saved yourself from lot of statistical testing. You must, however, be very careful when deciding that data is totally normal, just by looking at a QQ plot. Here is an example comparing histograms and corresponding qqplots. We can see how the quantiles of normal data appear as a straight line along the diagonal when plotted against a standard normal distribution's quantiles. The skewness and kurtosis of data can also be inspected in the same way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"qq.jpg\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that a qq plot helps us validate the assumption of normal distribution. It uses standardized values of residuals to determine the normal distribution of errors. Ideally, this plot should show a straight line. A curved, distorted line suggests residuals have a non-normal distribution.[Here is a good article](https://data.library.virginia.edu/understanding-q-q-plots/) explaining the interpretation of qqplots in detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality can be checked with a goodness of fit tests, e.g., the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.  When the data is not normally distributed a non-linear transformation (e.g., log-transformation) also fixes this issue."

    "> heteroscedasticity (also spelled heteroskedasticity) refers to the circumstance in which the variability of a variable is unequal across the range of values of a second variable that predicts it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A scatterplot of these variables will often create a cone-like shape, as the scatter (or variability) of the dependent variable  widens or narrows as the value of the independent variable increases. The inverse of heteroscedasticity is homoscedasticity, which indicates that a DV's variability is equal across values of an IV.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](homo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So a scatter plot is good way to check whether the data are homoscedastic (meaning the residuals are equal across the regression line).  The following scatter plots show examples of data that are not homoscedastic (i.e., heteroscedastic). You can also use significance tests like Breusch-Pagan / Cook – Weisberg test or White general test to detect this phenomenon. If we find p < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and infer that heteroscedasticity is present.\n",
